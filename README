NAME
    Alt::Class::Tiny::ButPerl56 - alternative distribution of Class::Tiny,
    with Perl 5.6 support

SYNOPSIS
       use Class::Tiny;

DESCRIPTION
    This is an alternative distribution of Class::Tiny, allowing use on Perl
    5.6.x. If you have had no problems installing Class::Tiny, then you do not
    need this module!

    Hopefully an official release of Class::Tiny with support for Perl 5.6
    will happen, and I'll be able to remove this abomination from the CPAN.
    :-)

    Version 0.001 of Alt::Class::Tiny::ButPerl56 includes version 0.014 of
    Class::Tiny.

SEE ALSO
    Alt, Class::Tiny.

COPYRIGHT, LICENCE, AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
